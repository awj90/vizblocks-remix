# VizBlocks

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Description

![architecture](architecture.png)

The project uses [Remix](https://remix.run/), which is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web fundamentals to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. The backend is powered by [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/).

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.

## Notes
The deployment uses vercel which provides a hobby tier for personal projects. As this repo has been migrated to the VisualizationLiteracy organisation, vercel requires us to use a Team account which requires $$$. A work around is to move this folder to a personal repo again to set up the CI/CD.
